# Warhazard-UA: Ukrainian War Visualization Project

The aim of this project was to provide a hazard score for all locations in Ukraine that were involved in war-related events such battles, explosions/remote violence events, violence against civilians and factors that pose risk to civilians living in those locations. The idea is to take those factors and condense them into one readable and comprehensible score which would reflect the danger level of the associated location.
